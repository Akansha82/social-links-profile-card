## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Working on this project helped me understand how to center elements using Flexbox and how to create a vertical layout for buttons using Flexbox. I also learned how to use the `box-shadow` property to create shadow effects that add depth to elements.

Here's a snippet of code I'm proud of:

``` css
.card-link {
   align-items: center;
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    gap: 20px; 
    margin-top: 8%;
  }
  
  .card-btn {
    width: 80%; 
    padding: 15px;
    background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 20%);
    color: #fff;
    border: none;
    border-radius: 6px;
    font-size: 0.9rem;
    font-weight: 700;
    text-align: center;
    cursor: pointer;
  } 
  
This CSS centers the .container both horizontally and vertically within the viewport.
```

### Continued development

In future projects, I plan to:

- Improve accessibility features by using more ARIA roles and attributes.
- Explore advanced CSS techniques such as CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Enhance my JavaScript skills to add interactivity to web pages.
